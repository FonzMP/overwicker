# Overview

Overwicker is a 'made for fun' application to assist a user in selecting a character while playing the game of <a href="https://playoverwatch.com/">Overwatch</a>. It's core concept is to randomly generate a character for selection in quick play. This application is developed in my free time while rotating through rounds with family and friends.

# Future Plans

- Remove multiple arrays and create Objects with character `name`, `img_url`, `role`.
- Expand to create Team Selector (selecting six characters with 2 tanks, 1 healer and 3 damage dealers)
- Expanding to create Team Selector where user picks quantity of each role.
